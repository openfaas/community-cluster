If you're new to OpenFaaS Cloud, then checkout [the user guide](https://docs.openfaas.com/openfaas-cloud/user-guide/)

There's two options for getting started. Free hosted access, or self-service.

## A) Get free hosted access

By applying you have read and agree to the [terms and conditions of the Community Cluster](https://github.com/openfaas/openfaas-cloud/blob/master/PRIVACY.md).

### 1. Apply for access

First off you should [apply for access](https://forms.gle/8e6ZXJKMcDHpV6Xu6). All applications will be reviewed, so please fill them out accurately and make sure you agree to the terms and conditions of the platform.

### 2. After you receive your confirmation email

When you receive your confirmation email, you'll already have access. Your username will also be added to a [CUSTOMERS file](https://github.com/openfaas/openfaas-cloud/blob/master/CUSTOMERS) in the openfaas-cloud repo.

### 3. Deploy your first function with the New User Guide

From here you have a couple of options for kicking the tires. It's recommended to try both:

* First try the [quick start](./docs/) to help you familiarise yourself with how OpenFaaS Cloud works
* Then run through the walk-through in the [New User Guide](https://docs.openfaas.com/openfaas-cloud/user-guide/) to deploy an API with Node.js and Express.js

You will also be [invited to OpenFaaS Slack](https://docs.openfaas.com/community/) where you can ask questions in the `#openfaas-cloud` channel.

If you want to keep up to date and help support the costs of your free account, you can do so via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/alexellis/).

## B) DIY / self-service

If you'd like to spin up your own OpenFaaS Cloud for your team, or for development you can use the [ofc-bootstrap](https://github.com/openfaas/ofc-bootstrap) tool. Once you have configured GitHub or GitLab, the bootstrap process takes around 100 seconds.
